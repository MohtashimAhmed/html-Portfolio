<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! I am Mohtashim Ahmed Khan, and my educational journey has been filled with excitement and discovery. My academic foundation was established at Beacon House School, where I completed both O levels and A levels. After laying this solid groundwork, I pursued my passion for electrical engineering and achieved a bachelor's degree in the field. This educational path instilled in me a profound curiosity for technology and sustainable solutions.</p>

<p>Driven by my interest in renewable energy, I immersed myself in the solar power system industry. I have been fortunate to gain one year of invaluable experience, working on various solar projects that contribute to a greener and more sustainable future. Presently, I am proud to be a part of Delta Energy, where I bring my skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the field of sustainable energy solutions.</p>

<p>Eager to embrace growth and new challenges, I have embarked on a full-stack web development course through Udemy. The course has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me, and I am thoroughly enjoying the process of learning and mastering the art of web development. This new skill set holds the promise of a rewarding and exciting career path, as I aspire to seek web development opportunities in the future.

  Beyond my professional endeavors, I find joy in traveling and embarking on adventurous long drives. To maintain a balanced lifestyle, I also dedicate my free time to physical fitness, regularly hitting the gym. And when relaxation calls, I find myself immersed in the virtual realm, indulging in the thrill of playing Fortnite on my PlayStation 4. I firmly believe in cherishing every aspect of life and in continuously striving to become a well-rounded individual.</p>
